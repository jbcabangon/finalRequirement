		<h2>1. Bubble Sort</h2>
		<p>A sorting algorithm that repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order until the list is sorted.</p>


		<h2>2. Selection Sort</h2>
		<p>A sorting algorithm that divides the list into sorted and unsorted parts and repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted part and places it at the beginning.</p>


		<h2>3. Insertion Sort</h2>
		<p>A sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted list one element at a time by inserting each element into its correct position.</p>


		<h2>4. Linear Search</h2>
		<p>A searching algorithm that checks each element in a list one by one until the target value is found or the list ends.</p>


		<h2>5. Binary Search</h2>
		<p>A searching algorithm that works on a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the target value is found or the search space is empty.</p>


		<h2>6. Factorial</h2>
		<p>An algorithm that calculates the product of all positive integers from 1 up to a given number, usually denoted as (n!).</p>


		<h2>7. Fibonacci Sequence</h2>
		<p>An algorithm that generates a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.</p>


		<h2>8. Palindrome Check</h2>
		<p>An algorithm that determines whether a word, number, or string reads the same forward and backward.</p>


		<h2>9. Prime Number Check</h2>
		<p>An algorithm that checks whether a number is prime, meaning it has only two distinct positive divisors.<br> 1 and itself.</p>


		<h2>10. Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)</h2>
		<p>An algorithm that finds the largest positive integer that divides two or more numbers without leaving a remainder.<br>For example: GCD of 12 and 18 is 6.</p>
